# Website Project

## Description

I started on this project to learn who to clean up and modify pre-written code. My modivation was to grow at identifying
redundant and unnecessary code. I learned a lot about how to correctly correlate the html and CSS with what I am seeing on 
the page. 


## Installation

To find success in this project I had study and identify different html elements. This helped me to categorize the page in an
html firendly way. I then had to study, and learn what all the CSS classes were doing so I could look for redundancy, and 
pull out code that wasn't needed. 

## Usage

One example of this would be creating header and footer classes. This helps the website be more html friendly and easier to navigate. In the CSS The classes for the side bar were all written for 3 seprate sections when they could have all used one CSS class. I removed the extra classes and linked them all to one class. 

## Credits

I give credit to all of my class mates who were able to connect with me so I could bounce ideas off of them.
